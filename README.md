# Analysis-on-Gold-and-Silver-Prices-vs-Geopolitical-Risk

Examining the changing connection between geopolitical risk and precious metal markets. Specifically, the prices of gold and silver between 1985 and 2025 are the aim of this investigation. The purpose of the study is to determine whether geopolitical tensions, as measured by a global geopolitical risk index, have an obvious effect on the price of gold and silver, which are typically regarded as safe-haven investments. The ultimate goal is to find out how well gold and silver protect against geopolitical unpredictability and how investors' ideas of risk and security have changed over the past four decades.  
The research questions are:  
(1) Do geopolitical risk indexes and gold and silver prices have a relationship that is statistically significant 
(correlation or causal linkage)?  
(2) Is gold a greater "safe haven" than silver, and do they react differently to growing global tension?
